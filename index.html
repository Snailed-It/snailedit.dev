  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Snailed It Development Ltd is an independent development company formed by a group of friends from around the world.  Across five timezones, we came together to make software that we want to see and use in the world, working to provide solutions that help people in their day-to-day lives.  At Snailed It, we believe that software doesnâ€™t work unless it is both powerful and well-designed, so we aim to make products that our users enjoy using.</p>
