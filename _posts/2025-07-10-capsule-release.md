**Never miss taking a medication again with Capsule! Out now for iPhone and iPad.**

We are very excited to be announcing the release of our latest app Capsule.
Capsule is a medication tracking app designed to make your life simpler and easier while ensuring you never miss taking a medication again.

- Add your medications and use the advanced scheduling options to ensure you take them at the right time, every time.
- Select between three different due types—schedules, intervals and one off due dates—which combined with the ability to set a minimum time between doses allow for powerful and customisable setups to suit every need.
- If you find you get sidetracked after seeing a notification and forget to take your medication, enable Repeat Notifications to be regularly reminded until you mark your medication as taken.
- Tags let you easily keep your medications organised.
- A detailed history view lets you easily see at a glance when you’ve been taking your medications to discuss with your doctor.
- Use Widgets and Shortcuts to easily manage your medications as you go about your day.

Capsule is available to download now on the [App Store for both iPhone and iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/capsule-medication-tracker/id6744626190).

We really hope you love it as much as we do.
