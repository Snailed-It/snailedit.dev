It's been a busy few months here at Snailed It Industries, and we're very excited to be able to announce the release of our newest app â€” [Menu Box](https://menubox.app).

As some of you may know Alex Hay was working on Menu Box when he tragically passed away, and we are truly honoured to have been entrusted by his family and the community at large to continue his legacy, and be able to release it.

Menu Box is an app designed to provide beautiful custom menus for use in your advanced Shortcuts.  Menu Items are fully customisable, allowing you to add an emoji, SF Symbol, existing App Icon, or your own image, as well as allowing you to add a data payload to be read in via your Shortcuts.

Menu Box helps make your Shortcuts even more powerful and is especially perfect when paired with the Action Button. You know, in case there is any news about that in the next few days. :eyes:
